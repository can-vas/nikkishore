RECOMMENDED editor of choice: GZDoom Builder by MaxED & CodeImp.
Website: http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/doombuilder2-gzdb/

Instructions:
After installing (extracting) the editor, place this cfg file in your
Configurations folder. Then set up the configuration with the WADs
pointing to:

- the Freedoom: Phase 2 IWAD (named Freedoom2.wad)
- the trunk folder

NOTE: DO NOT run the maps without following the above instructions
first.

Use the latest ZDoom build as your testing engine.  
Available at http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/zdoom/

You can use GZDoom, but it's more better to use ZDoom for
maximum compatibility.
